# entropy-splitter
An autosplitter for **The Entropy Centre**. 

Currently works on versions 1.0.7, 1.0.11, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3.

Timer **starts** upon starting a New Game or upon starting a chapter from the Chapter Select.

Timer **splits** upon completing a chapter and upon reaching the ending credits.

Optionally, the timer can instead start upon entering a custom level and split upon completing it.

During all loads, pauses and menuing the timer is paused.
